# Ising-Model-Python-
## Overview
This python project produces a Monte Carlo simulation for the Ising model in 1D, 2D, and 3D lattices, utilising the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The program allows the user to determine the dimensions and external conditions of the lattice, as well as the parameters of the algorithm. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm then generates a range of thermodynamic data from the simulation, from which the user can identify the point at which the lattice undergoes ferromagnetic phase transiton.
